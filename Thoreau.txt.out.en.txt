I heartily accept the motto, "That government is best which governsleast"; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly andsystematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also Ibelieve- "That government is best which governs not at all"; and whenmen are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government whichthey will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but mostgovernments are usually, and all governments are sometimes,inexpedient. The objections which have been brought against a standingarmy, and they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may alsoat last be brought against a standing government. The standing army isonly an arm of the standing government. The government itself, whichis only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will,is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can actthrough it. Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparativelya few individuals using the standing government as their tool; for,in the outset, the people would not have consented to this measure.  This American government- what is it but a tradition, though arecent one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity,but each instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitalityand force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it tohis will. It is a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves. Butit is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have somecomplicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that ideaof government which they have. Governments show thus howsuccessfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, fortheir own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow. Yet thisgovernment never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by thealacrity with which it got out of its way. It does not keep thecountry free. It does not settle the West. It does not educate. Thecharacter inherent in the American people has done all that has beenaccomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if thegovernment had not sometimes got in its way. For government is anexpedient by which men would fain succeed in letting one anotheralone; and, as has been said, when it is most expedient, thegoverned are most let alone by it. Trade and commerce, if they werenot made of india-rubber, would never manage to bounce over theobstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way; and,if one were to judge these men wholly by the effects of theiractions and not partly by their intentions, they would deserve to beclassed and punished with those mischievous persons who putobstructions on the railroads.  But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who callthemselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government,but at once a better government. Let every man make known what kind ofgovernment would command his respect, and that will be one step towardobtaining it.  After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in thehands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long periodcontinue, to rule is not because they are most likely to be in theright, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but becausethey are physically the strongest. But a government in which themajority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice, even as faras men understand it. Can there not be a government in whichmajorities do not virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience?-in which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule ofexpediency is applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or inthe least degree, resign his conscience to the legislation? Why hasevery man a conscience, then? I think that we should be men first, andsubjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for thelaw, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have aright to assume is to do at any time what I think right. It is trulyenough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation ofconscientious men is a corporation with a conscience. Law never mademen a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, eventhe well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A common andnatural result of an undue respect for law is, that you may see a fileof soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys, andall, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars,against their wills, ay, against their common sense and consciences,which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces apalpitation of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnablebusiness in which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined.Now, what are they? Men at all? or small movable forts andmagazines, at the service of some unscrupulous man in power? Visit theNavy-Yard, and behold a marine, such a man as an American governmentcan make, or such as it can make a man with its black arts- a mereshadow and reminiscence of humanity, a man laid out alive andstanding, and already, as one may say, buried under arms withfuneral accompaniments, though it may be,        "Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,          As his corse to the rampart we hurried;        Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot          O';er the grave where our hero we buried."  The mass of men serve the state thus, not as men mainly, butGoogle Translate for Business:Translator ToolkitWebsite TranslatorGlobal Market Finder  asmachines, with their bodies. They are the standing army, and themilitia, jailers, constables, posse comitatus, etc. In most casesthere is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moralsense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth andstones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve thepurpose as well. Such command no more respect than men of straw or alump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses anddogs. Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens.Others- as most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, andoffice-holders- serve the state chiefly with their heads; and, as theyrarely make any moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve thedevil, without intending it, as God. A very few- as heroes,patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and men- serve thestate with their consciences also, and so necessarily resist it forthe most part; and they are commonly treated as enemies by it. Awise man will only be useful as a man, and will not submit to be"clay," and "stop a hole to keep the wind away," but leave that officeto his dust at least:        "I am too high-born to be propertied,         To be a secondary at control,         Or useful serving-man and instrument         To any sovereign state throughout the world."  He who gives himself entirely to his fellow-men appears to themuseless and selfish; but he who gives himself partially to them ispronounced a benefactor and philanthropist.  How does it become a man to behave toward this American governmenttoday? I answer, that he cannot without disgrace be associated withit. I cannot for an instant recognize that political organization asmy government which is the slave';s government also.  All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right torefuse allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when itstyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable. But almostall say that such is not the case now. But such was the case, theythink, in the Revolution Of ';75. If one were to tell me that thiswas a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commoditiesbrought to its ports, it is most probable that I should not make anado about it, for I can do without them. All machines have theirfriction; and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance theevil. At any rate, it is a great evil to make a stir about it. Butwhen the friction comes to have its machine, and oppression androbbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine anylonger. In other words, when a sixth of the population of a nationwhich has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves, and awhole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army, andsubjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon forhonest men to rebel and revolutionize. What makes this duty the moreurgent is the fact that the country so overrun is not our own, butours is the invading army.  Paley, a common authority with many on moral questions, in hischapter on the "Duty of Submission to Civil Government," resolvesall civil obligation into expediency; and he proceeds to say that"so long as the interest of the whole society requires it, that is, solong as the established government cannot be resisted or changedwithout public inconveniency, it is the will of God... that theestablished government be obeyed- and no longer. This principlebeing admitted, the justice of every particular case of resistanceis reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger andgrievance on the one side, and of the probability and expense ofredressing it on the other." Of this, he says, every man shall judgefor himself. But Paley appears never to have contemplated thosecases to which the rule of expediency does not apply, in which apeople, as well as an individual, must do justice, cost what it may.If I have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning man, I must restoreit to him though I drown myself. This, according to Paley, would beinconvenient. But he that would save his life, in such a case, shalllose it. This people must cease to hold slaves, and to make war onMexico, though it cost them their existence as a people.  In their practice, nations agree with Paley; but does any onethink that Massachusetts does exactly what is right at the presentcrisis?        "A drab of state, a cloth-o';-silver slut,         To have her train borne up, and her soul trail in the dirt."Practically speaking, the opponents to a reform in Massachusetts arenot a hundred thousand politicians at the South, but a hundredthousand merchants and farmers here, who are more interested incommerce and agriculture than they are in humanity, and are notprepared to do justice to the slave and to Mexico, cost what it may. Iquarrel not with far-off foes, but with those who, near at home,cooperate with, and do the bidding of those far away, and without whomthe latter would be harmless. We are accustomed to say, that themass of men are unprepared; but improvement is slow, because the feware not materially wiser or better than the many. It is not soimportant that many should be as good as you, as that there be someabsolute goodness somewhere; for that will leaven the whole lump.There are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to thewar, who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them; who,esteeming themselves children of Washington and Franklin, sit downwith their hands in their pockets, and say that they know not whatto do, and do nothing; who even postpone the question of freedom tothe question of free trade, and quietly read the prices-currentalong with the latest advices from Mexico, after dinner, and, it maybe, fall asleep over them both. What is the price-current of an honestman and patriot today? They hesitate, and they regret, and sometimesthey petition; but they do nothing in earnest and with effect. Theywill wait, well disposed, for others to remedy the evil, that they mayno longer have it to regret. At most, they give only a cheap vote, anda feeble countenance and God-speed, to the right, as it goes bythem. There are nine hundred and ninety-nine patrons of virtue toone virtuous man. But it is easier to deal with the real possessorof a thing than with the temporary guardian of it.  All voting is a sort of gaming, like checkers or backgammon, witha slight moral tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moralquestions; and betting naturally accompanies it. The character ofthe voters is not staked. I cast my vote, perchance, as I think right;but I am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail. I amwilling to leave it to the majority. Its obligation, therefore,never exceeds that of expediency. Even voting for the right is doingnothing for it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire thatit should prevail. A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy ofchance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority.There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men. When themajority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery, it will bebecause they are indifferent to slavery, or because there is butlittle slavery left to be abolished by their vote. They will then bethe only slaves. Only his vote can hasten the abolition of slavery whoasserts his own freedom by his vote.  I hear of a convention to be held at Baltimore, or elsewhere, forthe selection of a candidate for the Presidency, made up chiefly ofeditors, and men who are politicians by profession; but I think,what is it to any independent, intelligent, and respectable man whatdecision they may come to? Shall we not have the advantage of hiswisdom and honesty, nevertheless? Can we not count upon someindependent votes? Are there not many individuals in the country whodo not attend conventions? But no: I find that the respectable man, socalled, has immediately drifted from his position, and despairs of hiscountry, when his country has more reason to despair of him. Heforthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected as the onlyavailable one, thus proving that he is himself available for anypurposes of the demagogue. His vote is of no more worth than that ofany unprincipled foreigner or hireling native, who may have beenbought. O for a man who is a man, and, as my neighbor says, has a bonein his back which you cannot pass your hand through! Our statisticsare at fault: the population has been returned too large. How many menare there to a square thousand miles in this country? Hardly one. Doesnot America offer any inducement for men to settle here? TheAmerican has dwindled into an Odd Fellow-one who may be known by thedevelopment of his organ of gregariousness, and a manifest lack ofintellect and cheerful self-reliance; whose first and chief concern,on coming into the world, is to see that the almshouses are in goodrepair; and, before yet he has lawfully donned the virile garb, tocollect a fund for the support of the widows and orphans that maybe; who, in short, ventures to live only by the aid of the MutualInsurance company, which has promised to bury him decently.  It is not a man';s duty, as a matter of course, to devote himselfto the eradication of any, even the most enormous, wrong; he may stillproperly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, atleast, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer,not to give it practically his support. If I devote myself to otherpursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do notpursue them sitting upon another man';s shoulders. I must get off himfirst, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what grossinconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, "Ishould like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrectionof the slaves, or to march to Mexico;- see if I would go"; and yetthese very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and soindirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute. Thesoldier is applauded who refuses to serve in an unjust war by thosewho do not refuse to sustain the unjust government which makes thewar; is applauded by those whose own act and authority he disregardsand sets at naught; as if the state were penitent to that degreethat it differed one to scourge it while it sinned, but not to thatdegree that it left off sinning for a moment. Thus, under the nameof Order and Civil Government, we are all made at last to pay homageto and support our own meanness. After the first blush of sin comesits indifference; and from immoral it becomes, as it were, unmoral,and not quite unnecessary to that life which we have made.  The broadest and most prevalent error requires the mostdisinterested virtue to sustain it. The slight reproach to which thevirtue of patriotism is commonly liable, the noble are most likelyto incur. Those who, while they disapprove of the character andmeasures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support areundoubtedly its most conscientious supporters, and so frequently themost serious obstacles to reform. Some are petitioning the State todissolve the Union, to disregard the requisitions of the President.Why do they not dissolve it themselves- the union between themselvesand the State- and refuse to pay their quota into its treasury? Do notthey stand in the same relation to the State that the State does tothe Union? And have not the same reasons prevented the State fromresisting the Union which have prevented them from resisting theState?  How can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely, and enjoyit? Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he isaggrieved? If you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbor,you do not rest satisfied with knowing that you are cheated, or withsaying that you are cheated, or even with petitioning him to pay youyour due; but you take effectual steps at once to obtain the fullamount, and see that you are never cheated again. Action fromprinciple, the perception and the performance of right, changes thingsand relations; it is essentially revolutionary, and does not consistwholly with anything which was. It not only divides States andchurches, it divides families; ay, it divides the individual,separating the diabolical in him from the divine.  Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall weendeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, orshall we transgress them at once? Men generally, under such agovernment as this, think that they ought to wait until they havepersuaded the majority to alter them. They think that, if theyshould resist, the remedy would be worse than the evil. But it isthe fault of the government itself that the remedy is worse than theevil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to anticipate andprovide for reform? Why does it not cherish its wise minority? Whydoes it cry and resist before it is hurt? Why does it not encourageits citizens to be on the alert to point out its faults, and do betterthan it would have them? Why does it always crucify Christ, andexcommunicate Copernicus and Luther, and pronounce Washington andFranklin rebels?  One would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of itsauthority was the only offence never contemplated by government; else,why has it not assigned its definite, its suitable andproportionate, penalty? If a man who has no property refuses butonce to earn nine shillings for the State, he is put in prison for aperiod unlimited by any law that I know, and determined only by thediscretion of those who placed him there; but if he should stealninety times nine shillings from the State, he is soon permitted to goat large again.  If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine ofgovernment, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wearsmooth- certainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has aspring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worsethan the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you tobe the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law.Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I haveto do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrongwhich I condemn.  As for adopting the ways which the State has provided forremedying the evil, I know not of such ways. They take too muchtime, and a man';s life will be gone. I have other affairs to attendto. I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good place tolive in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has noteverything to do, but something; and because he cannot doeverything, it is not necessary that he should do something wrong.It is not my business to be petitioning the Governor or theLegislature any more than it is theirs to petition me; and if theyshould not bear my petition, what should I do then? But in this casethe State has provided no way: its very Constitution is the evil. Thismay seem to be harsh and stubborn and unconciliatory; but it is totreat with the utmost kindness and consideration the only spiritthat can appreciate or deserves it. So is an change for the better,like birth and death, which convulse the body.  I do not hesitate to say, that those who call themselvesAbolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their support,both in person and property, from the government of Massachusetts, andnot wait till they constitute a majority of one, before they sufferthe right to prevail through them. I think that it is enough if theyhave God on their side, without waiting for that other one.Moreover, any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majorityof one already.  I meet this American government, or its representative, the Stategovernment, directly, and face to face, once a year- no more- in theperson of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a mansituated as I am necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly,Recognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual, and, in thepresent posture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treatingwith it on this head, of expressing your little satisfaction withand love for it, is to deny it then. My civil neighbor, thetax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with- for it is, afterall, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel- and he hasvoluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he everknow well what he is and does as an officer of the government, or as aman, until he is obliged to consider whether he shall treat me, hisneighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposedman, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he canget over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder andmore impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action. I knowthis well, that if one thousand, if one hundred, if ten men whom Icould name- if ten honest men only- ay, if one HONEST man, in thisState of Massachusetts, ceasing to hold slaves, were actually towithdraw from this copartnership, and be locked up in the countyjail therefor, it would be the abolition of slavery in America. For itmatters not how small the beginning may seem to be: what is oncewell done is done forever. But we love better to talk about it: thatwe say is our mission, Reform keeps many scores of newspapers in itsservice, but not one man. If my esteemed neighbor, the State';sambassador, who will devote his days to the settlement of the questionof human rights in the Council Chamber, instead of being threatenedwith the prisons of Carolina, were to sit down the prisoner ofMassachusetts, that State which is so anxious to foist the sin ofslavery upon her sister- though at present she can discover only anact of inhospitality to be the ground of a quarrel with her- theLegislature would not wholly waive the subject the following winter.  Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true placefor a just man is also a prison. The proper place today, the onlyplace which Massachusetts has provided for her freer and lessdesponding spirits, is in her prisons, to be put out and locked out ofthe State by her own act, as they have already put themselves out bytheir principles. It is there that the fugitive slave, and the Mexicanprisoner on parole, and the Indian come to plead the wrongs of hisrace should find them; on that separate, but more free andhonorable, ground, where the State places those who are not withher, but against her- the only house in a slave State in which afree man can abide with honor. If any think that their influence wouldbe lost there, and their voices no longer afflict the ear of theState, that they would not be as an enemy within its walls, they donot know by how much truth is stronger than error, nor how much moreeloquently and effectively he can combat injustice who has experienceda little in his own person. Cast your whole vote, not a strip of papermerely, but your whole influence. A minority is powerless while itconforms to the majority; it is not even a minority then; but it isirresistible when it clogs by its whole weight. If the alternativeis to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and slavery, theState will not hesitate which to choose. If a thousand men were not topay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent andbloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State tocommit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, thedefinition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. Ifthe tax-gatherer, or any other public officer, asks me, as one hasdone, "But what shall I do?" my answer is, "If you really wish to doanything, resign your office." When the subject has refusedallegiance, and the officer has resigned his office, then therevolution is accomplished. But even suppose blood should flow. Isthere not a sort of blood shed when the conscience is wounded? Throughthis wound a man';s real manhood and immortality flow out, and hebleeds to an everlasting death. I see this blood flowing now.  I have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender, rather thanthe seizure of his goods- though both will serve the same purpose-because they who assert the purest right, and consequently are mostdangerous to a corrupt State, commonly have not spent much time inaccumulating property. To such the State renders comparatively smallservice, and a slight tax is wont to appear exorbitant, particularlyif they are obliged to earn it by special labor with their hands. Ifthere were one who lived wholly without the use of money, the Stateitself would hesitate to demand it of him. But the rich man- not tomake any invidious comparison- is always sold to the institution whichmakes him rich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the lessvirtue; for money comes between a man and his objects, and obtainsthem for him; and it was certainly no great virtue to obtain it. Itputs to rest many questions which he would otherwise be taxed toanswer; while the only new question which it puts is the hard butsuperfluous one, how to spend it. Thus his moral ground is takenfrom under his feet. The opportunities of living are diminished inproportion as what are called the "means" are increased. The bestthing a man can do for his culture when he is rich is to endeavor tocarry out those schemes which he entertained when he was poor.Christ answered the Herodians according to their condition. "Show methe tribute-money," said he;- and one took a penny out of his pocket;-if you use money which has the image of Caesar on it, and which he hasmade current and valuable, that is, if you are men of the State, andgladly enjoy the advantages of Caesar';s government, then pay himback some of his own when he demands it. "Render therefore to Caesarthat which is Caesar';s, and to God those things which are God';s"-leaving them no wiser than before as to which was which; for theydid not wish to know.  When I converse with the freest of my neighbors, I perceive that,whatever they may say about the magnitude and seriousness of thequestion, and their regard for the public tranquillity, the long andthe short of the matter is, that they cannot spare the protection ofthe existing government, and they dread the consequences to theirproperty and families of disobedience to it. For my own part, I shouldnot like to think that I ever rely on the protection of the State.But, if I deny the authority of the State when it presents itstax-bill, it will soon take and waste all my property, and so harassme and my children without end. This is hard. This makes it impossiblefor a man to live honestly, and at the same time comfortably, inoutward respects. It will not be worth the while to accumulateproperty; that would be sure to go again. You must hire or squatsomewhere, and raise but a small crop, and eat that soon. You mustlive within yourself, and depend upon yourself always tucked up andready for a start, and not have many affairs. A man may grow rich inTurkey even, if he will be in all respects a good subject of theTurkish government. Confucius said: "If a state is governed by theprinciples of reason, poverty and misery are subjects of shame; if astate is not governed by the principles of reason, riches and honorsare the subjects of shame." No: until I want the protection ofMassachusetts to be extended to me in some distant Southern port,where my liberty is endangered, or until I am bent solely onbuilding up an estate at home by peaceful enterprise, I can affordto refuse allegiance to Massachusetts, and her right to my propertyand life. It costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty ofdisobedience to the State than it would to obey. I should feel as if Iwere worth less in that case.  Some years ago, the State met me in behalf of the Church, andcommanded me to pay a certain sum toward the support of a clergymanwhose preaching my father attended, but never I myself. "Pay," itsaid, "or be locked up in the jail." I declined to pay. But,unfortunately, another man saw fit to pay it. I did not see why theschoolmaster should be taxed to support the priest, and not the priestthe schoolmaster; for I was not the State';s schoolmaster, but Isupported myself by voluntary subscription. I did not see why thelyceum should not present its tax-bill, and have the State to back itsdemand, as well as the Church. However, at the request of theselectmen, I condescended to make some such statement as this inwriting:- "Know all men by these presents, that I, Henry Thoreau, donot wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated societywhich I have not joined." This I gave to the town clerk; and he hasit. The State, having thus learned that I did not wish to beregarded as a member of that church, has never made a like demand onme since; though it said that it must adhere to its originalpresumption that time. If I had known how to name them, I shouldthen have signed off in detail from all the societies which I neversigned on to; but I did not know where to find a complete list.  I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once onthis account, for one night; and, as I stood considering the wallsof solid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron,a foot thick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I couldnot help being struck with the foolishness of that institution whichtreated me as if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be lockedup. I wondered that it should have concluded at length that this wasthe best use it could put me to, and had never thought to avail itselfof my services in some way. I saw that, if there was a wall of stonebetween me and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one toclimb or break through before they could get to be as free as I was. Idid not for a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great wasteof stone and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen hadpaid my tax. They plainly did not know how to treat me, but behavedlike persons who are underbred. In every threat and in everycompliment there was a blunder; for they thought that my chiefdesire was to stand the other side of that stone wall. I could not butsmile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations,which followed them out again without let or hindrance, and theywere really all that was dangerous. As they could not reach me, theyhad resolved to punish my body; just as boys, if they cannot come atsome person against whom they have a spite, will abuse his dog. Isaw that the State was half-witted, that it was timid as a lonewoman with her silver spoons, and that it did not know its friendsfrom its foes, and I lost all my remaining respect for it, andpitied it.  Thus the State never intentionally confronts a man';s sense,intellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is notarmed with superior wit or honesty, but with superior physicalstrength. I was not born to be forced. I will breathe after my ownfashion. Let us see who is the strongest. What force has amultitude? They only can force me who obey a higher law than I. Theyforce me to become like themselves. I do not hear of men beingforced to have this way or that by masses of men. What sort of lifewere that to live? When I meet a government which says to me, "Yourmoney or your life," why should I be in haste to give it my money?It may be in a great strait, and not know what to do: I cannot helpthat. It must help itself; do as I do. It is not worth the while tosnivel about it. I am not responsible for the successful working ofthe machinery of society. I am not the son of the engineer. I perceivethat, when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side, the one does notremain inert to make way for the other, but both obey their ownlaws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they can, till one,perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a plant cannotlive according to its nature, it dies; and so a man.  The night in prison was novel and interesting enough. Theprisoners in their shirt-sleeves were enjoying a chat and theevening air in the doorway, when I entered. But the jailer said,"Come, boys, it is time to lock up"; and so they dispersed, and Iheard the sound of their steps returning into the hollow apartments.My room-mate was introduced to me by the jailer as "a first-ratefellow and a clever man." When the door was locked, he showed me whereto hang my hat, and how he managed matters there. The rooms werewhitewashed once a month; and this one, at least, was the whitest,most simply furnished, and probably the neatest apartment in the town.He naturally wanted to know where I came from, and what brought methere; and, when I had told him, I asked him in my turn how he camethere, presuming him to be an honest man, of course; and, as the worldgoes, I believe he was. "Why," said he, "they accuse me of burning abarn; but I never did it." As near as I could discover, he hadprobably gone to bed in a barn when drunk, and smoked his pipethere; and so a barn was burnt. He had the reputation of being aclever man, had been there some three months waiting for his trialto come on, and would have to wait as much longer; but he was quitedomesticated and contented, since he got his board for nothing, andthought that he was well treated.  He occupied one window, and I the other; and I saw that if onestayed there long, his principal business would be to look out thewindow. I had soon read all the tracts that were left there, andexamined where former prisoners had broken out, and where a gratehad been sawed off, and heard the history of the various occupantsof that room; for I found that even here there was a history and agossip which never circulated beyond the walls of the jail. Probablythis is the only house in the town where verses are composed, whichare afterward printed in a circular form, but not published. I wasshown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some youngmen who had been detected in an attempt to escape, who avengedthemselves by singing them.  I pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as I could, for fear I shouldnever see him again; but at length he showed me which was my bed,and left me to blow out the lamp.  It was like travelling into a far country, such as I had neverexpected to behold, to lie there for one night. It seemed to me that Inever had heard the town clock strike before, nor the evening soundsof the village; for we slept with the windows open, which wereinside the grating. It was to see my native village in the light ofthe Middle Ages, and our Concord was turned into a Rhine stream, andvisions of knights and castles passed before me. They were thevoices of old burghers that I heard in the streets. I was aninvoluntary spectator and auditor of whatever was done and said in thekitchen of the adjacent village inn- a wholly new and rareexperience to me. It was a closer view of my native town. I was fairlyinside of it. I never had seen its institutions before. This is one ofits peculiar institutions; for it is a shire town. I began tocomprehend what its inhabitants were about.  In the morning, our breakfasts were put through the hole in thedoor, in small oblong-square tin pans, made to fit, and holding a pintof chocolate, with brown bread, and an iron spoon. When they calledfor the vessels again, I was green enough to return what bread I hadleft; but my comrade seized it, and said that I should lay that up forlunch or dinner. Soon after he was let out to work at haying in aneighboring field, whither he went every day, and would not be backtill noon; so he bade me good-day, saying that he doubted if he shouldsee me again.  When I came out of prison- for some one interfered, and paid thattax- I did not perceive that great changes had taken place on thecommon, such as he observed who went in a youth and emerged atottering and gray-headed man; and yet a change had to my eyes comeover the scene- the town, and State, and country- greater than anythat mere time could effect. I saw yet more distinctly the State inwhich I lived. I saw to what extent the people among whom I livedcould be trusted as good neighbors and friends; that theirfriendship was for summer weather only; that they did not greatlypropose to do right; that they were a distinct race from me by theirprejudices and superstitions, as the Chinamen and Malays are; thatin their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks, not even to theirproperty; that after all they were not so noble but they treated thethief as he had treated them, and hoped, by a certain outwardobservance and a few prayers, and by walking in a particularstraight though useless path from time to time, to save their souls.This may be to judge my neighbors harshly; for I believe that manyof them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jailin their village.  It was formerly the custom in our village, when a poor debtor cameout of jail, for his acquaintances to salute him, looking throughtheir fingers, which were crossed to represent the grating of a jailwindow, "How do ye do?" My neighbors did not thus salute me, but firstlooked at me, and then at one another, as if I had returned from along journey. I was put into jail as I was going to the shoemaker';s toget a shoe which was mended. When I was let out the next morning, Iproceeded to finish my errand, and, having put on my mended shoe,joined a huckleberry party, who were impatient to put themselves undermy conduct; and in half an hour- for the horse was soon tackled- wasin the midst of a huckleberry field, on one of our highest hills,two miles off, and then the State was nowhere to be seen.  This is the whole history of "My Prisons."  I have never declined paying the highway tax, because I am asdesirous of being a good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject;and as for supporting schools, I am doing my part to educate myfellow-countrymen now. It is for no particular item in the tax-billthat I refuse to pay it. I simply wish to refuse allegiance to theState, to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually. I do notcare to trace the course of my dollar, if I could, till it buys aman or a musket to shoot one with- the dollar is innocent- but I amconcerned to trace the effects of my allegiance. In fact, I quietlydeclare war with the State, after my fashion, though I will still makewhat use and get what advantage of her I can, as is usual in suchcases.  If others pay the tax which is demanded of me, from a sympathywith the State, they do but what they have already done in their owncase, or rather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the Staterequires. If they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in theindividual taxed, to save his property, or prevent his going tojail, it is because they have not considered wisely how far they lettheir private feelings interfere with the public good.  This, then, is my position at present. But one cannot be too much onhis guard in such a case, lest his action be biased by obstinacy or anundue regard for the opinions of men. Let him see that he does onlywhat belongs to himself and to the hour.  I think sometimes, Why, this people mean well, they are onlyignorant; they would do better if they knew how: why give yourneighbors this pain to treat you as they are not inclined to? But Ithink again, This is no reason why I should do as they do, or permitothers to suffer much greater pain of a different kind. Again, Isometimes say to myself, When many millions of men, without heat,without ill will, without personal feeling of any kind, demand ofyou a few shillings only, without the possibility, such is theirconstitution, of retracting or altering their present demand, andwithout the possibility, on your side, of appeal to any othermillions, why expose yourself to this overwhelming brute force? You donot resist cold and hunger, the winds and the waves, thus obstinately;you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities. You do not putyour head into the fire. But just in proportion as I regard this asnot wholly a brute force, but partly a human force, and considerthat I have relations to those millions as to so many millions of men,and not of mere brute or inanimate things, I see that appeal ispossible, first and instantaneously, from them to the Maker of them,and, secondly, from them to themselves. But if I put my headdeliberately into the fire, there is no appeal to fire or to the Makerof fire, and I have only myself to blame. If I could convince myselfthat I have any right to be satisfied with men as they are, and totreat them accordingly, and not according, in some respects, to myrequisitions and expectations of what they and I ought to be, then,like a good Mussulman and fatalist, I should endeavor to besatisfied with things as they are, and say it is the will of God. And,above all, there is this difference between resisting this and apurely brute or natural force, that I can resist this with someeffect; but I cannot expect, like Orpheus, to change the nature of therocks and trees and beasts.  I do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation. I do not wish tosplit hairs, to make fine distinctions, or set myself up as betterthan my neighbors. I seek rather, I may say, even an excuse forconforming to the laws of the land. I am but too ready to conform tothem. Indeed, I have reason to suspect myself on this head; and eachyear, as the tax-gatherer comes round, I find myself disposed toreview the acts and position of the general and State governments, andthe spirit of the people, to discover a pretext for conformity.        "We must affect our country as our parents,         And if at any time we alienate         Our love or industry from doing it honor,         We must respect effects and teachGoogle Translate for Business:Translator ToolkitWebsite TranslatorGlobal Market Finder  the soul         Matter of conscience and religion,         And not desire of rule or benefit."I believe that the State will soon be able to take all my work of thissort out of my hands, and then I shall be no better a patriot thanmyGoogle Translate for Business:Translator ToolkitWebsite TranslatorGlobal Market Finder  fellow-countrymen. Seen from a lower point of view, theConstitution, with all its faults, is very good; the law and thecourts are very respectable; even this State and this Americangovernment are, in many respects, very admirable, and rare things,to be thankful for, such as a great many have described them; but seenfrom a point of view a little higher, they are what I have describedthem; seen from a higher still, and the highest, who shall say whatthey are, or that they are worth looking at or thinking of at all?  However, the government does not concern me much, and I shall bestowthe fewest possible thoughts on it. It is not many moments that I liveunder a government, even in this world. If a man is thought-free,fancy-free, imagination-free, that which is not never for a longtime appearing to be to him, unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatallyinterrupt him.  I know that most men think differently from myself; but thosewhose lives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindredsubjects content me as little as any. Statesmen and legislators,standing so completely within the institution, never distinctly andnakedly behold it. They speak of moving society, but have noresting-place without it. They may be men of a certain experienceand discrimination, and have no doubt invented ingenious and evenuseful systems, for which we sincerely thank them; but all their witand usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits. They arewont to forget that the world is not governed by policy andexpediency. Webster never goes behind government, and so cannotspeak with authority about it. His words are wisdom to thoselegislators who contemplate no essential reform in the existinggovernment; but for thinkers, and those who legislate for all time, henever once glances at the subject. I know of those whose serene andwise speculations on this theme would soon reveal the limits of hismind';s range and hospitality. Yet, compared with the cheap professionsof most reformers, and the still cheaper wisdom and eloquence ofpoliticians in general, his are almost the only sensible andvaluable words, and we thank Heaven for him. Comparatively, he isalways strong, original, and, above all, practical. Still, his qualityis not wisdom, but prudence. The lawyer';s truth is not Truth, butconsistency or a consistent expediency. Truth is always in harmonywith herself, and is not concerned chiefly to reveal the justicethat may consist with wrong-doing. He well deserves to be called, ashe has been called, the Defender of the Constitution. There are reallyno blows to be given by him but defensive ones. He is not a leader,but a follower. His leaders are the men of ';87- "I have never madean effort," he says, "and never propose to make an effort; I havenever countenanced an effort, and never mean to countenance an effort,to disturb the arrangement as originally made, by which the variousStates came into the Union." Still thinking of the sanction whichthe Constitution gives to slavery, he says, "Because it was a partof the original compact- let it stand." Notwithstanding his specialacuteness and ability, he is unable to take a fact out of its merelypolitical relations, and behold it as it lies absolutely to bedisposed of by the intellect- what, for instance, it behooves a man todo here in America today with regard to slavery- but ventures, or isdriven, to make some such desperate answer as the following, whileprofessing to speak absolutely, and as a private man- from whichwhat new and singular code of social duties might be inferred? "Themanner," says he, "in which the governments of those States whereslavery exists are to regulate it is for their own consideration,under their responsibility to their constituents, to the generallaws of propriety, humanity, and justice, and to God. Associationsformed elsewhere, springing from a feeling of humanity, or any othercause, have nothing whatever to do with it. They have never receivedany encouragement from me, and they never will."  They who know of no purer sources of truth, who have traced up itsstream no higher, stand, and wisely stand, by the Bible and theConstitution, and drink at it there with reverence and humility; butthey who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or thatpool, gird up their loins once more, and continue their pilgrimagetoward its fountain-head.  No man with a genius for legislation has appeared in America. Theyare rare in the history of the world. There are orators,politicians, and eloquent men, by the thousand; but the speaker hasnot yet opened his mouth to speak who is capable of settling themuch-vexed questions of the day. We love eloquence for its own sake,and not for any truth which it may utter, or any heroism it mayinspire. Our legislators have not yet learned the comparative value offree trade and of freedom, of union, and of rectitude, to a nation.They have no genius or talent for comparatively humble questions oftaxation and finance, commerce and manufactures and agriculture. If wewere left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in Congress for ourguidance, uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectualcomplaints of the people, America would not long retain her rank amongthe nations. For eighteen hundred years, though perchance I have noright to say it, the New Testament has been written; yet where isthe legislator who has wisdom and practical talent enough to availhimself of the light which it sheds on the science of legislation?  The authority of government, even such as I am willing to submit to-for I will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than I,and in many things even those who neither know nor can do so well-is still an impure one: to be strictly just, it must have the sanctionand consent of the governed. It can have no pure right over myperson and property but what I concede to it. The progress from anabsolute to a limited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to ademocracy, is a progress toward a true respect for the individual.Even the Chinese philosopher was wise enough to regard theindividual as the basis of the empire. Is a democracy, such as we knowit, the last improvement possible in government? Is it not possible totake a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights ofman? There will never be a really free and enlightened State until theState comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independentpower, from which all its own power and authority are derived, andtreats him accordingly. I please myself with imagining a State atleast which can afford to be just to all men, and to treat theindividual with respect as a neighbor; which even would not think itinconsistent with its own repose if a few were to live aloof fromit, not meddling with it, nor embraced by it, who fulfilled all theduties of neighbors and fellow-men. A State which bore this kind offruit, and suffered it to drop off as fast as it ripened, wouldprepare the way for a still more perfect and glorious State, whichalso I have imagined, but not yet anywhere seen.                                  THE END
